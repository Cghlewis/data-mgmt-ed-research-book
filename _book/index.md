# About

<img src="book_featured.PNG" class="cover" width="250" height="328"/>This is the in-progress version of *Data Management in Large-Scale Education Research*. To see a previous version of this material in module format, visit this [website](https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/).

<hr>

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports; for example, a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

## Usage 

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

## Render book

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:


```r
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:


```r
bookdown::serve_book()
```
