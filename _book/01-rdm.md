# Research Data Management

## What is research data management?

Research data management (RDM) involves the broad process of planning and implementing standardized practices across the research life cycle [@borghi_promoting_2022]. The practices of managing data begin long before data is ever collected, during the planning phase, and continue well after a research project ends during the archiving phase. 

While organizations like Data Documentation Initiative and Dublin Core have developed metadata standards for fields to adopt, it is common knowledge that there are no agreed-upon norms for managing data within and across disciplines within the field of education. The rules for how data should be collected, organized, stored, described, and shared is often left up to each individual team, as long as external requirements of the IRB and funders are met [@tenopir_data_2016-1]. With a growing interest in open science practices and expanding requirements for federally funded research to make data publicly available [@office_of_science_and_technology_policy_ostp_2022], data repositories will most likely begin to play a stronger role in promoting standards for many data management practices around data formats and documentation [@borghi_promoting_2022].

## Why care about research data management?

Without agreed-upon standards in the field, it is important for research teams to develop their own data management standards that apply within and across all of their projects. There are both external pressures and personal reasons to care about developing research data management standards.

### External Reasons

1. **Funder compliance**: Since 2013, even earlier for the National Science Foundation, most federal agencies that education researchers work with have required a data management plan as part of their funding application. While the focus of these plans is mostly on the future outcome of data sharing, the data management plan is a means of ensuring that researchers will thoughtfully plan for a research study that will result in data that can be shared with confidence, free from errors, uncertainty, or violations of confidentiality. President Obama’s May 2013 Executive Order declared that “the default state of new and modernized government information resources shall be open and machine readable" [@the_white_house_executive_2013]. In August of 2022, the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) doubled down on their data sharing policy and issued a memorandum stating that all federal agencies must update their public access policies no later than December 31, 2025, to make federally funded publications and their supporting data accessible to the public with no embargo on their release [@office_of_science_and_technology_policy_ostp_2022]. Along with this mandatory data sharing policy, comes the incentive to manage your data for the purposes of data sharing [@borghi_promoting_2022].

1. **Journal compliance**: Depending on what journal you publish with, providing open access to the data associated with your publication may be a requirement. Again, along with data sharing, comes the incentive to manage your data in a thoughtful, responsible, and organized way.

1. **Compliance with legal and ethical mandates**: If you are required to submit your research project to the Institutional Review Board, they will monitor how you manage your data. They care about the welfare, rights, and privacy of research participants and will have rules for how data is managed and stored securely.

1. **Open science practices**: With a growing interest in open science practices, sharing well managed data, curated in a reproducible way is "a strong indicator to fellow researchers of rigor, trustworthiness, and transparency in scientific research" (Alston & Rick, 2021, p.2 [@alston_beginners_2021]). Sharing data that has been managed in a reproducible way allows others to learn from your work, validate your results to strengthen evidence, as well as potentially catch errors in your work, preventing decisions being made based on incorrect data [@alston_beginners_2021]. Well-managed data with sufficient documentation can also lead to more collaboration and greater impact as collaborators are able to access and understand your data with ease [@borghi_promoting_2022; @cowles_research_nodate].

### Personal reasons

Even if you never plan to share your data outside of your research group, there are still many compelling reasons to manage your data.

1. **Contributes to reproducibility**: Reproducible research “is a by-product of careful attention to detail throughout the research process" (Alston & Rick, 2021, p.2 [@alston_beginners_2021]). Even if you are not concerned with others being able to reproduce your work (which is unlikely), you most likely want you and your team members to be able to reproduce each other’s work, ensuring you can trust your results.

1. **Improve continuity**: Implementing reproducible practices ensures project continuity through staff turnover. Having developed thorough protocols allows new staff to pick up right where the project left off, and implement the project with fidelity [@borghi_data_2021; @cowles_research_nodate].

1. **Increases efficiency**: Documenting and automating tasks reduces duplication of efforts for repeating tasks, especially in longitudinal studies.

1. **Reduces burden and saves time, energy, and resources**: Taking the time to implement quality data management through the entire research study reduces data curation debt caused by suboptimal data management practices [@butters_recognizing_2020]. Having poorly managed or documented data may make your data unusable, either permanently or until errors are corrected. Decreasing or removing this debt reduces the time, energy, and resources spent at the end of your study scrambling to fix errors made in poorly designed data collection instruments, gathering duplicate data that was lost, or documenting efforts long after most information has been forgotten.

1. **Improve efficiency**: Being able to find and understand your data when you need it is a huge benefit. It allows for the use and re-use of your data, and hastens efforts like the publication process. Not having to search around for numbers of consented participants or asking which version of the data you should use allows you to spend more time analyzing and writing and less time playing detective.

1. **Increases reliability**: Errors come in many forms, from both humans and technology. Implementing quality control procedures allow you to have confidence in your data. Without implementing these practices, your research findings could include extra noise, missing data, or erroneous or misleading results.

1. **Improves data security**: Quality data management practices reduce the risk of lost or stolen data, the risk of data becoming corrupted or inaccessible, and the risk of breaking confidentiality agreements.
