</h2>
<p>In 2013, without knowing that the term research data management existed, I accepted a job as a Research Associate with a prevention science research center. My job was to coordinate the collection and management of data for federally funded randomized controlled trial efficacy studies taking place in K-12 schools, along with a team of PIs, other full-time staff, part-time data collectors, and graduate students. While I had some experience analyzing and working with education data, i.e. ECKLS-K, I had no experience running research grants, collecting original data, or managing research data, but I was excited to learn.</p>
<p>In my time in that position I learned to plan, schedule, and track data collection activities, create data collection tools, organize and document data inputs, and produce usable data outputs; but I didn’t learn to do these things through any formal training. There were no books, courses, or workshops that I learned from. I learned from colleagues and a large amount of trial and error. Since then, as I have met more PIs, data managers, and project coordinators in education research, I realize that this is a common method for learning data management (mentoring and “winging it”). And while learning data management through these informal methods helps us get by, the ramifications of this unstandardized system are felt by both the project team and future data users.</p>

</h2>
<p>Research data management is becoming more complicated. We are collecting more data, in sometimes very novel ways, and using more complex technologies, all while increasing the visibility of our work with the push for data sharing and open science practices.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Kristin Briney, &lt;em&gt;Data Management for Researchers: Organize, Maintain and Share Your Data for Research Success&lt;/em&gt;, Research Skills Series (Exeter, &lt;span&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;: Pelagic Publishing, 2015).&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a></span> Ad hoc data management practices may have worked for us in the past, but now others need to understand our processes as well, requiring researchers to be more thoughtful in planning their data management routines.</p>

</h3>
<p>In order to implement thoughtful and standardized data management practices, researchers need training. Yet there is a clear lack of data management training in higher education. In a survey of 274 psychology researchers, Borghi and Van Gulick<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;John A. Borghi and Ana E. Van Gulick, &lt;span&gt;“Data Management and Sharing: Practices and Perceptions of Psychology Researchers,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;ONE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 16, no. 5 (May 21, 2021): e0252047, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252047" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252047&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a></span> found that only 33% of respondents learned data management from college level coursework, while 64% learned from collaborators, and 52% learned from self-education. In their survey of 202 education researchers (PIs and Co-PIs), Ceviren and Logan<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;A. Busra Ceviren and Jessica Logan, &lt;span&gt;“Ceviren_logan_EHE_forum_2022.pdf”&lt;/span&gt; (presentation, presentation, April 4, 2022), &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19514368.v1" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19514368.v1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>4</sup></a></span> found that over 60% of respondents reported having no formal training in data management, yet across eight different data management practices, respondents were responsible for data management activities anywhere from 25-50% of the time.</p>
<p>Without training, resources and formal support systems are the next best option for learning best practices. During my data management journey I have discovered an excellent support system of professionals in university systems, i.e. research data librarians, who can consult with research teams in their data management planning, and I have also come across some solid existing research data management books and manuals which I will link to in this book. However, while education researchers are starting to put out some excellent resources,<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;R. C. Neild, D. Robinson, and J. Agufa, &lt;span&gt;“Sharing Study Data: A Guide for Education Researchers.

Researchers are often collecting data in real-world environments, such as school systems, and keeping that data secure and reliable in a deliberate and orderly way can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>Last, unfortunately, while other fields of research, such as psychology, appear to be banding together to develop standards around how to structure and share data,<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Psych-&lt;span&gt;DS&lt;/span&gt; Specification.

This lack of standards leads to inconsistencies in the quality of data products across the field.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;John Borghi and Ana Van Gulick, &lt;span&gt;“Promoting Open Science Through Research Data Management,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Harvard Data Science Review&lt;/em&gt;, July 28, 2022, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.9497f68e" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.9497f68e&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>

</h3>
<p>A lack of training in data management practices and an absence of agreed upon standards in the field of education leads to consequences. Implementing inconsistent data management practices, while typically only resulting in frustration and time lost, also has the potential to be devastating, resulting in analyzing erroneous data or even unusable or lost data. In a review of 1,082 retracted publications from the journal PubMed from 2013-2016, authors found that 32% of retractions were due to data management errors.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Isabel Campos-Varela and Alberto Ruano-Raviña, &lt;span&gt;“Misconduct as the Main Cause for Retraction.

<p>Poor data management can even prevent researchers from implementing other good open science practices. In waves 1 and 2 of the Open Scholarship Survey being collected by the Center for Open Science, the team has found that of the education researchers surveyed who are currently not publicly sharing their research data, about 10% mentioned “being nervous about mistakes” as a reason for not sharing.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Open Science Foundation, &lt;span&gt;“&lt;span&gt;COS&lt;/span&gt; Engagement with the Education Community”&lt;/span&gt; (2022), &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LpyVOj8oJPr3SVkRM2GfCFnl2Qeo10YbbqcqwtwrVUM" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LpyVOj8oJPr3SVkRM2GfCFnl2Qeo10YbbqcqwtwrVUM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>11</sup></a></span> The well known replication crisis is another reason to be concerned with data management. Failure to implement practices such as quality documentation or standardization of practices (among many other reasons), resulted in one study finding that across 1,500 researchers surveyed, more than 70% had tried and failed to reproduce another researcher’s study.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Monya Baker, &lt;span&gt;“1,500 Scientists Lift the Lid on Reproducibility,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 533, no. 7604 (May 1, 2016): 452–54, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/533452a" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;https://doi.org/10.1038/533452a&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>12</sup></a></span></p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> About this book<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#about-this-book"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>While the field as a whole may not have agreed upon guidelines for data management, there are still best practices that are proven to result in more usable, reproducible, and reliable data. My hope is that this book can be a foundation to help researchers think through how to build a quality, standardized data management workflow that works for their team and their projects. As suggested in the title of this book, this content is designed to specifically help teams navigate the complicated workflows associated with large-scale research studies, such as randomized controlled trial studies, but ultimately these practices are applicable to any research project, no matter the scale.</p>
<p>This book should be viewed as a handbook to be referenced regularly and is not necessarily meant to be read in its entirety in one sitting. While perusing through the entire book to better understand the entire research data life cycle is very helpful, this book is also intended to have chapters referenced as needed when you are ready to start planning a specific phase of your project.</p>
<div id="what-this-book-will-cover" class="section level3" number="1.3.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> What this book will cover<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-this-book-will-cover"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>This book begins, like many other books in this subject area, by describing the research life cycle and how data management fits within the larger picture. The remaining chapters are then organized by each phase of the life cycle, with examples of best practices provided for each phase. Considerations on whether you should implement, and how to integrate those practices into your workflow will be discussed.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> What this book will not cover<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-this-book-will-not-cover"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>It is important to also point out what this book will not cover. This book is intended to be tool agnostic and provide suggestions that anyone can use, no matter what tools you work with, especially when it comes to data cleaning. Therefore, while I might mention options of tools you can use for different tasks, I will not advocate for any specific tools.</p>
<p>There are also no specific coding practices or actual syntax included in this book. To be honest, in many ways I feel that the actual “data cleaning” phase of data management is the <em>easiest</em> phase to implement, as long as you implement good practices up until that point. Because of that, this book introduces practices in all phases leading up to data cleaning that will prepare your data for minimal cleaning. With that said, I do provide examples of what I would expect to see in a data cleaning process, I just do not provide steps for any specific software system. That is beyond the scope of this book.</p>
<p>This book will also not talk about analysis or preparing data for analysis through means such as data imputation, removal of legitimate outliers, or calculating analysis specific variables. This book is written from the perspective of a data manager, and that perspective is to implement practices that keep data in its most complete and true, but usable form, for any future researcher to analyze in a way that works best for them.</p>

<p>This book is for anyone involved in a research study involving original data collection. This book in particular focuses on quantitative, observational data collection, while I do think that many of the practices covered can also apply to qualitative data as well. This book also applies to any team member, ranging from PIs, to data managers, to project staff, to students, to contractual data collectors. The contents of this book are useful for anyone who may have a part in planning, collecting, or organizing research study data.</p>

<p>Planning and implementing new data management practices on top of planning the implementation of your entire research grant can feel overwhelming. However, the idea of this book is to find the practices that work for you and your team and implement them consistently. For some teams that may look like implementing just a few of the suggestions mentioned and for others it may involve implementing all of the suggestions. Improving your data management workflow is a process and it becomes easier over time as those practices become part of your normal routine. At some point you may even find that you enjoy working on data management processes as you start to see the benefits of their implementation!</p>

<p>This book is a compilation of lessons I have learned in my personal experiences as a data manager, knowledge collected from existing books and papers (many written by librarians or those involved in the open science movement), as well as advice and stories collected through interviews with other researchers who work with data. I want to be clear that I did not study research data management, unlike research data librarians who are experts in this content. Much of this book will be based off of lessons learned from firsthand experience and this book is my attempt to hopefully save others from making the same mistakes I have personally made or seen others make. I can not emphasize enough that if you work for a university and you have the opportunity to consult with a librarian for your project, you absolutely should!</p>
<p>With that said, there is a long list of people I would like to acknowledge for their contributions to this book and for supporting me in this process.</p>
