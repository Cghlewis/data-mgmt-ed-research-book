<p>Once you have gone through all cycles of data collection and you are preparing to wrap up your grant, you will need to plan for long-term storage and use of files after a project is complete (see Figure <a href="archiving-data.html#fig:fig13-2">15.1</a>). While your project may be ending, there are still many reasons to retain your data long-term including internal reuse, opportunities to make corrections (e.g., going back to paper files if an error is found in the data), and data retention requirements from funders and institutions. In this section we will discuss how to care for internal files, while public data sharing and archiving will be discussed in Chapter <a href="share.html#share">16</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>First, review your requirements for data retention and destruction
<ul>
<li>There may be varying requirements for both data retention and destruction depending on your oversight (e.g., institution requirements, funder requirements, data sharing agreement requirements). It is common for oversight to require that you retain your data anywhere from 3-5 years and there may be specific destruction requirements for data that contain PII. Make sure to review documentation from relevant policies to determine what is required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make a plan for retention and destruction
<ul>
<li>If you are required to retain your data for a specified number of years, consider how you will continue to store data, and documentation, in a way that meets your original goals (e.g., data safety, protecting confidentiality, accessibility and usability of files).
<ul>
<li>Paper
<ul>
<li>When it comes to paper data, many institutions have records management departments that can assist you with long-term storage of paper files. These departments typically store your physical files for a designated set of time, as well as assist in destruction of files once that period has ended. Note that you may not want to use this solution until you are certain you will no longer need to easily access your paper files (e.g., for fixing errors, entering any additional information). If destroying paper files on your own (e.g., sometimes it is required to destroy documents containing PII, such as contact lists or classroom rosters, as soon as they are no longer needed), make sure to choose a quality destruction method such as paper shredding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Electronic
<ul>
<li>For electronic data long-term storage, you will want to consider two things, file formats and storage location <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-borer_simple_2009" role="doc-biblioref">Borer et al. 2009</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-briney_data_2015" role="doc-biblioref">Briney 2015</a>)</span>.
<ul>
<li>File formats
<ul>
<li>First, choose file types that are widely used (i.e., don’t require proprietary software) for both accessibility as well as preventing your file formats from becoming obsolete (see Figure <a href="archiving-data.html#fig:fig13-3">15.2</a>). This means that you can still keep copies of your files in a format such as SPSS if you prefer, but it is good practice to have a second copy of your data in a non-proprietary format such as CSV. Your documentation file formats should also be considered. Formats such as PDF or TXT are often recommended for long-term storage of text documents while CSV is a good format for tabular data dictionaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Storage location
<ul>
<li>Similar to choosing file formats, choose a storage location that is accessible and not at risk of becoming corrupt or obsolete (e.g., think obsolescence of floppy disks). If your short-term storage solution meets these requirements (e.g., your institution network drive), you may not need to do anything different in preparing for long-term storage, but it will be important to continue implementing good practices to keep your data safe (e.g., continuing data backups). When it comes time to destroy data, make sure to permanently delete files, including all backups of files. When deleting PII, this often involves more than just moving files to the trash can on your computer. Work with your institution IT department during this process.</li>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Consider how you will share data internally
<ul>
<li>At the end of a project, or possibly earlier in the project, it is important to consider where you will store final datasets in your storage location (i.e., a specific folder), how you will notify team members of their availability, and how you will allow team members, and other research partners, to access data. An example of this process may look like this:
<ul>
<li>Storing all finalized datasets (i.e., cleaned and de-identified) in a “master dataset” folder (see Chapter <a href="clean.html#clean">14</a> for more information)<br>
</li>
<li>Adding descriptions of the finalized datasets to a data inventory (see Section <a href="document.html#document-inventory">8.1.4</a>)<br>
</li>
<li>Creating a data request process for team members, or external partners, to request access to finalized study datasets for various reporting and analysis purposes. Most likely you will not want researchers going in to “master data” folders and grabbing datasets without consulting with a core team member first. Therefore, it is important to develop a system for providing data to researchers on an as-needed basis. Some recommendations for setting up this system include:
<ul>
<li>Design a system for requesting access (e.g., designate a person to email, develop a survey form that is submitted to a designated person)
<ul>
<li>In that system, the researcher should describe what data they are requesting (i.e., what variables, from what time periods), as well as the purpose of their analysis. It may be helpful to build a data request process that involves providing data dictionaries and other documentation to researchers to review before requesting data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decide who needs to review the request to ensure all requested information is available (e.g., a data manager), and who needs to give final approval for the data request submission (e.g., a PI)</li>
<li>Design a system for gathering data for requestors (e.g., will you provide researchers with full datasets or will you narrow datasets based on specific requests)
<ul>
<li>If narrowing datasets for researchers, where will new datasets be stored? (e.g., a “data request” folder) (see Figure <a href="archiving-data.html#fig:fig13-4">15.3</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consider how you will share datasets with researchers (e.g., a secure link to a cloud folder, using secure file transfer)</li>
<li>Consider how you will track data requests
<ul>
<li>It is important to keep track of data requests in case of situations such as errors found in the data. In those cases, you can reach back out to researchers to inform them that errors were found and new versions of the data are available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>Last, if maintaining your electronic data long-term sounds like too much effort for your team, there are other options. Many universities have institutional repositories that often include services such as data curation and preservation. Additionally, there are several external repositories that offer curation and preservation services where you may be able to deposit your data for long-term storage. It’s possible that depositing your data in one of these two options may also align with publicly sharing your data, which we will review in Chapter <a href="share.html#share">16</a>.</p>
