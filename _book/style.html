Figure 9.1: Style guide in the research project life cycle
</p>
</div>
<p>A style guide provides general agreed upon rules for the formatting of information. As mentioned in Chapter <a href="document.html#document">8</a>, style guides can be created to standardize procedures such as variable naming, variable value coding, file naming, file versioning, file structure, and even coding practices.</p>
<p>Style guides create standardization within and across projects. The benefits of using them consistently include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating interoperability: This allows data to easily be combined or compared across forms or time.</li>
<li>Improving interpretation: Consistent and clear structure, naming, and coding allows your files and variables to be findable and understandable to both humans and computers.</li>
<li>Increasing reproducibility: If the organization of your file paths, file naming, or variable naming constantly change it undermines the reproducibility of any data management or analysis code you have written.</li>
</ul>
<p>Style guides can be created for individual projects, but they can also be created at the team level, to be applied across all projects. Most importantly, they should be created before a project kicks off so you can implement them as soon as your project begins. If you do not have a team-wide style guide already created, you most likely will want to create a project-level style guide during your planning phase so that you can begin setting up your directory structures and file naming standards before you start creating and saving project-related files.</p>
<p>Style guides can be housed in one large document, with a table of contents used to reference each section, or they can be created as separate documents. Either way, style guides should be stored in a central location that is easily accessible to all team members (such as a team or project wiki), and all team members should be trained, and periodically retrained, on the style guide to ensure adherence to the rules. If all team members are not consistently implementing the style guide, then the benefits of the guide are lost.</p>
<p>For the remainder of this chapter, we will spend time reviewing some good practices for rules to add to your style guides for the following purposes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Structuring directories</li>
<li>Naming files</li>
<li>Naming variables</li>
<li>Assigning variable values</li>
<li>Styling your syntax files</li>
</ol>
<p>While some best practices will be provided below, ultimately the rules you choose to add to each style guide should be chosen based on which practices work best for your projects and your team. Whatever rules you settle on, write them in a style guide so that everyone is following the same rules within and across projects.</p>
<div id="general-good-practices" class="section level2" number="9.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> General good practices<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#general-good-practices"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Before we dive in to particular types of style guides, there are a few things to understand about how computers read names in order to understand the “why” behind some of these practices.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Avoid spaces.
<ul>
<li>While some applications (like Windows) recognize spaces, command line operations and some operating systems still do not support them so it is best to avoid them all together. Furthermore, they can often break a URL when shared</li>
<li>The underscore <code>_</code> and hyphen <code>-</code> are good delimiters to use in place of spaces
<ul>
<li>It is worth noting that <code>_</code> can be difficult to read when file paths are shared in links that are underlined to denote that the path is clickable (for example when sharing a SharePoint link to a document)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With the exception of <code>_</code> and <code>-</code>, avoid special characters
<ul>
<li>Examples include but are not limited to <code>?</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>\</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>'</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>"</code>
</li>
<li>Computers assign specific meaning to many of these special characters</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are several existing naming conventions that you can choose to add to your style guide. Different naming conventions may work better for different purposes. Using these conventions help you to be consistent with both delimeters and capitalization which not only makes your names more human-readable but also allows your computer to read and search names easier.
<ul>
<li>Pascal case (ScaleSum)</li>
<li>Snake case (scale_sum)</li>
<li>Camel case (scaleSum)</li>
<li>Kebab case (scale-sum)</li>
<li>Train case (Scale-Sum)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Character length matters. Computers are unable to read names that surpass a certain character length. This applies to file paths, file names, and variable names. Considerations for each type of limit are reviewed below.</li>
</ol>

<div id="directory-structure" class="section level2" number="9.2">

</h2>
<p>When deciding how to structure your project directories (the organization of your operating systems folders and files), there are several things you want to consider.</p>
<p><strong>When structuring your folders:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First, consider organizing your directory into a hierarchical folder structure to clearly delineate segments of your projects and improve searchability
<ul>
<li>The alternative to using a folder structure is using metadata and tagging to organize and search for files <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-cakici_folders_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Cakici 2017</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-fuchs_making_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Fuchs and Kuusniemi 2018</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-krishna_how_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Krishna 2018</a>)</span>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When creating your folder structure, strike a balance between a deep and shallow structure
<ul>
<li>Too shallow leads to too many files in one folder which is difficult to sort through</li>
<li>Too deep leads to too many clicks to get to one file, plus file paths can max out with too many characters. A file path includes the full length of both folders and file names
<ul>
<li>An example file path with 70 characters <code>W:\team\projecta\data\wave1\student\survey\projecta-w1-stu-svy-raw.csv</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Examples of file path limits:
<ul>
<li>SharePoint/OneDrive path limit is 400 characters <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-microsoft_restrictions_2023" role="doc-biblioref">Microsoft 2023</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>Windows path limit is 260 characters <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-ashcraft_naming_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Ashcraft 2022</a>)</span>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create folders that are specific enough that you can limit access
<ul>
<li>For example you will want to limit user access to folders that hold Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</li>
<li>To protect any files that you don’t want others to accidentally edit (for example your clean datasets), also consider making some files “read only”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decide if you want an “archive” folder to move old files into or if you want to leave previous versions in the same folder</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When naming your folders:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consider setting a character limit on folder names (again to reduce problems with hitting path character limits)</li>
<li>Make your folder names meaningful and easy to interpret</li>
<li>Never use spaces in your folder names
<ul>
<li>Use <code>_</code> or <code>-</code> to separate words</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With the exception of <code>-</code> and <code>_</code>, don’t use special characters in your folder names</li>
<li>Be consistent with delimiters and capitalization. Follow an existing naming convention (as mentioned above).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example directory structure style guide</strong></p>
<pre><code>1. All project directories follow this hierarchical metadata structure  
    - Level 1: Name of project  
    - Level 2: Life cycle folders  
    - Level 3: Data collection wave folders (if relevant)  
    - Level 4: Participant folder (if relevent)
    - Level 5: Specific content folder  
    - Level 6: Archive folders  
2. All folders should be named according to these rules  
    - Meaningful name but no longer than 20 characters  
    - No spaces or special characters in folder names  
    - Only use lower case letters  
    - Use `-` to separate words  
3. All previous versions of files must be placed into their respective "archive" folder
    - A changelog should be placed in all data "archive" folders to document changes between file versions</code></pre>

Figure 9.2: xkcd comic on naming files
</p>
</div>
<p>As <span class="citation">xkcd (<a href="references.html#ref-xkcd_documents_2023" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a>)</span> so aptly points out in Figure <a href="style.html#fig:fig9-2">9.2</a>, many of us are pretty bad at naming files in a consistent and usable way. We are often in a rush to save our files and maybe don’t consider how unclear our file names will be for future users (including ourselves).</p>
<p>Our file names alone should be able to answer questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are these documents?</li>
<li>When were these documents created?</li>
<li>Which document is the most recent version?</li>
</ul>
<p>A file naming style guide helps us to name files in a way that allows us to answer these questions. You can have one overarching file naming guide, or you may have file naming guides for different purposes that need different organizational strategies (for example one naming guide for project meeting notes, another naming guide for project data files). Let’s walk through several conventions to consider when naming your files.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make names descriptive (a user should be able to understand the contents of the file without opening it)</li>
<li>No PII should be used in a file name (e.g., participant name)</li>
<li>Never use spaces between words
<ul>
<li>Use <code>-</code> or <code>_</code> to separate words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With the exception of <code>_</code> and <code>-</code>, never use special characters</li>
<li>Be consistent with delimiters and capitalization. Follow an existing naming convention.</li>
<li>Consider limiting the number of allowable characters to prevent hitting your path limit (as mentioned above)</li>
<li>Do not use <code>/</code> in dates and format them consistently. It is beneficial to format dates using the ISO 8601 standard in one of these two ways:
<ul>
<li>
<em>YYYY-MM-DD</em> or <em>YYYYMMDD</em>
</li>
<li>While the first way adds more characters to your variable names, it also may be clearer for users to interpret. Either of these date formats will be sortable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When versioning your files, pick a format and add it to your style guide
<ul>
<li>If you plan to version using a number, consider left padding with 0 before single digit numbers to keep the file name the same length as it grows (<code>v01</code>, <code>v02</code>).</li>
<li>As mentioned in Section <a href="document.html#document-change">8.3.2</a>, it is possible to version programatically using tools like Git and GitHub. However, these tools are not always practical for education research, and the tools that are used in the field (e.g., SharePoint) often don’t have a way of documenting differences between versions. A more practical means of versioning, at least major file changes, may be to manually version files and track changes in a changelog.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your files need to be run in a sequential order, add the order number to the beginning of the file name, with leading zeros to ensure proper sorting (<code>01_</code>, <code>02_</code>)</li>
<li>Choose abbreviations and/or consistent terms to use for common names/phrases and add them to your style guide (<code>student</code> = <code>stu</code>).
<ul>
<li>This helps reduce file name character lengths and also creates standardized, searchable metadata, which can allow you to more easily, programmatically retrieve files (for example, retrieve all files containing the phrase “stu_obs_raw”).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep redundant metadata in the file name
<ul>
<li>This reduces confusion if you ever move a file to a different folder or send a file to a collaborator. It also makes your files searchable.</li>
<li>For example, always put the data collection wave in a file name, even if the file is currently housed in a specific wave folder, always put the project name in the file name, even if the file is currently housed in a project folder, or always put the word “raw” or “clean” in the file name, even if the file is housed in a “raw” or “clean” folder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choose an order for file name metadata (e.g., project -&gt; time -&gt; participant -&gt; measure)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example file naming style guide</strong></p>
<pre><code>1. Never use spaces between words
2. Never use special characters
3. Use _ to separate words
4. Only use lower case letters
5. Keep names under 40 characters
6. Use the following metadata file naming order:
  - Order of use (if relevant – add a 0 before single digits)
  - Project
  - Cohort/Wave (if relevant)
  - Participant
  - Instrument
  - Further description
  - Date (always add)
  - Version (if necessary)
7. Format dates as YYYY-MM-DD
8. If there are multiple versions of a document on the same date, version using v# with a leading 0.
9. Use the following abbreviations
  - student = stu
  - survey = svy
  - wave = w
  - project math efficacy = me</code></pre>

</h2>
<p>This style guide will be a necessary document to have before you start to create your data dictionaries. Below are several considerations to review before developing your variable naming style guide. These are broken into two types of rules, those that are non-negotiable requirements that really should be included in your style guide (if you do not follow these rules you will run into serious problems in interpretation for both humans and machines), and then best practices suggestions that are recommended but not required.</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t name a variable any keywords or functions used in any programming language (such as <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>repeat</code>) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-r_core_team_r_2023" role="doc-biblioref">R Core Team 2023</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-stangroom_rules_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Stangroom 2019</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>Set a character limit
<ul>
<li>Most statistical programs have a limit on variable name characters
<ul>
<li>SPSS is 64</li>
<li>Stata is 32</li>
<li>SAS is 32</li>
<li>Mplus is 8</li>
<li>R is 10,000</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With this said, do not limit yourself to 8 characters based on the fact that one future user may use a program like Mplus. Consider the balance between character limit and interpretation. It is very difficult to make good human-readable variable names under 8 characters. It is much easier to make them under 32. And the majority of your users will be using a program with a limit of 32 or more. If you have one potential Mplus user, they can always rename your variables for their specific analysis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use the same variable name across time in a project
<ul>
<li>If an item is named <code>anx1</code> in the fall, name that same item <code>anx1</code> again in the spring</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t use spaces or special characters (except<code>_</code>), they are not allowed in most programs
<ul>
<li>Even the <code>-</code> is not allowed in programs such as R and SPSS as it can be mistaken for a minus sign</li>
<li>While <code>.</code> is allowed in R and SPSS it is not allowed in Stata so it’s best to avoid using it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do not start a variable name with a number. This is not allowed in many statistical programs.</li>
<li>All variable names should be unique
<ul>
<li>This absolutely applies to variables within the same dataset, but it should also apply to all variables across datasets within a project. The reason is, at some point you may merge data across forms and end up with identical variable names (which programs will not allow).</li>
<li>So, for example if you collect student gender from a survey and you also collect student gender from district student records, differentiate between the two (<code>s_gender</code> and <code>d_gender</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you substantively change an item (substantive wording OR response options change) after at least one round of data has been collected, version your variable names in order to reduce errors in interpretation.
<ul>
<li>For example revised <code>anx1</code> becomes <code>anx1_v2</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggested:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Names should be meaningful
<ul>
<li>Instead of naming gender <code>q1</code>, name it <code>gender</code>
</li>
<li>If a variable is a part of a scale, consider using an abbreviation of that scale plus the scale item number (<code>anx1</code>, <code>anx2</code>, <code>anx3</code>)
<ul>
<li>Not only does this allow you to easily associate an item with a scale, but it also allows you to programatically select and manipulate scale items (for example, sum all items that start with “anx”)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have used the question/scale before, consider keeping the variable name the same across projects. This can be very useful if you ever want to combine data across projects.</li>
<li>Be consistent with delimiters and capitalization. Follow an existing naming convention. Most programming languages are case sensitive so consider this when choosing a convention that is feasible for your workflow.
<ul>
<li>Snake case (scale_sum) – preferred method for variable names
<ul>
<li>While pascal case and camel case are also options, the use of underscores helps more clearly delineate relevant pieces of metadata in your variable names</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kebab case (scale-sum) – don’t use for variable names</li>
<li>Train case (Scale-Sum) – don’t use for variable names</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a variable includes a “select all” option, start all associated variables with the same prefix (<code>cert_elem</code>, <code>cert_secondary</code>, <code>cert_leader</code>, <code>cert_other</code>). Again this allows you to easily see grouped items, as well as easily programatically manipulate those items as needed.</li>
<li>Consider denoting reverse coding in the variable name to reduce confusion (<code>anx1_r</code>)</li>
<li>Choose abbreviations and standard phrases to use across all variables. Using controlled vocabularies improves interpretation and also makes data exploration and manipulation easier <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-riederer_column_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Riederer 2020</a>)</span>.
<ul>
<li>mean = mean</li>
<li>scaled score = ss</li>
<li>percentile rank = pr</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Include an indication of the instrument in the variable name. This can also help with the unique variable name requirement above.
<ul>
<li>t = teacher self-report</li>
<li>s = student self-report</li>
<li>tr = teacher rating of student</li>
<li>d = district student records</li>
<li>
<code>t_conf1</code>, <code>s_anx2</code>, <code>tr_relate4</code>, <code>d_gender</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<span class="header-section-number">9.4.1</span> Time<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#time"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Before moving on there is one last consideration for variable names. If your data is longitudinal, you may need to add rules for accounting for time in your variable names as well. Recall from Chapter <a href="structure.html#structure">3</a>, there are two ways you can link data over time, in wide format or long format.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If combining data over time in long format, no changes need to be made to your variable names. Variable names should be identically named over time. To account for a time component, you will simply include a new variable (e.g., <code>time</code>, <code>year</code>, <code>wave</code>) and add the appropriate value for each row.</p></li>
<li><p>If combining data in wide format, you will need to concatenate time to all of your time varying variable names (i.e., not your subject unique identifier). This removes the problem of having non-unique variable names (e.g., <code>anx1</code> in wave 1 and <code>anx1</code> in wave 2) and allows you to interpret when each variable was collected. How you concatenate time to your variable names is up to you. Just make sure to continue adding time consistently to all variable names (i.e., same location, same format) and remember to follow variable naming best practices (e.g., never start a variable name with a number).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Before adding a time component, either as a new variable or as part of a variable name, it’s important to decide what values you want to assign to time. This will depend entirely on your study design and how you intend to use time in your analyses. When working with cohorts, it can be helpful to choose generic time values that allow you to combine samples collected in the same relative time periods (e.g., <code>wave 1</code> = fall of the study year, <code>wave 2</code> = spring of the study year, <code>wave 3</code> = fall of the follow up year). However, when not working with cohorts or if you have a dataset that does not fall within your pre-defined data collection periods, you can choose any values that work for you. Figure <a href="style.html#fig:fig9-3">9.3</a> provides just a few examples of how you might account for time in your data based on different scenarios.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:fig9-3"></span>

Figure 9.3: Examples of how time might be added to your data based on a variety of scenarios
</p>
</div>
<p>With all of that said, during an active project, it is actually best to not add a time component to your data, and to store each dataset as a distinct file, with a clear file name that denotes the appropriate time period. There are a few benefits of this method:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Naming variables consistently over time (with no time component added) allows you to easily reuse your data collection and data capture tools, as well as your cleaning code, each wave <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-reynolds_basics_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Reynolds, Schatschneider, and Logan 2022</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>Storing files separately prevents you from potentially wasting time combining your data in a way that ends up not actually being useful or from wasting time merging datasets that later need to be re-combined because you find an error in an individual dataset at some point.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, with that said, add rules to your variable naming style guide around how to concatenate time to your variable names, but make an asterisk saying that this time component should only be added when you are ready to combine files. Once you are ready to combine files, either for an analysis or other reasons, you can fairly quickly add a time variable or programatically concatenate time to variable names using a statistical program (e.g., R) or even in a program like Microsoft Excel.</p>

</h2>
<p>Oftentimes in education research we codify categorical values. This coding of values helps in both data entry, data scoring, and data analysis. As an example, rather than referring to the lengthier values of “yes” or “no” in a variable, we may code those values into a code/label pair. The code can be numeric (e.g., “yes” = 1 | “no” = 0) or character (e.g., “yes” = ‘y’ | “no” = ‘n’), depending on your needs. Ultimately, only the code appears in your data, while the code/label pair is represented in your data dictionary, allowing users to interpret the meaning of each code.</p>
<p>If you are planning to code any categorical variable values for your study, it can be helpful to include general guidelines in your style guide for assigning those codes. Some general good practices are outlined below.</p>
<p>First, if you are using a pre-existing measure, assign codes and labels in the manner that the technical documentation tells you to assign codes. That will be important for any further derivations you need to make later on based on those measures.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if you are assigning your own codes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Codes must be unique
<ul>
<li>Do: Assign “yes” = 1 | “no” = 0</li>
<li>Don’t: Assign “yes” = 1 | “no” = 1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Codes must be consistent within a variable
<ul>
<li>Do: For <code>gender</code> assign “male” = ‘m’</li>
<li>Don’t: For <code>gender</code> allow “male” = ‘m’ or ‘M’ or ‘Male’ or ‘male’</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Codes must be consistent across time
<ul>
<li>Do: For <code>anx1</code> assign “yes” = 1 | “no” = 0 in wave 1 <strong>and</strong> wave 2</li>
<li>Don’t: For <code>anx1</code> assign “yes” = 1 | “no” = 0 in wave 1 <strong>but</strong> “yes” = 1 | “no” = 2 in wave 2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Codes should be consistent across the project
<ul>
<li>Do: Assign “yes” = 1 | “no” = 0 as the value for all yes/no items</li>
<li>Don’t: Assign “yes” = 1 | “no” = 0 for some variables, and “yes” = 1 | “no” = 2 for others
<ul>
<li>The exception here is if a pre-existing measure determines how values are coded. In that case, there may be some inconsistency across items</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Order Likert-type scale response options in a logical way
<ul>
<li>Do: Assign “Strongly Disagree” = 1 | “Disagree” = 2 | “Agree” = 3 | “Strongly Agree” = 4</li>
<li>Don’t: Assign “Strongly Disagree” = 1 | “Disagree” = 3 | “Agree” = 4 | “Strongly Agree” = 2
<ul>
<li>The exception here is if a pre-existing measure tells you to code variables in a different way</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">9.5.1</span> Missing value coding<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#style-missing"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>There is little agreement about how missing data should be assigned <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-white_nine_2013" role="doc-biblioref">White et al. 2013</a>)</span>. There are essentially two options.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You can choose to leave all missing values as blank.
<ul>
<li>Benefits of this option is that there is no chance of assigned missing value codes (e.g., -999) being mistaken as actual values</li>
<li>The concern with this method is that there is no way to discern if the value is truly missing, or was potentially erased by accident or skipped over during data entry <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-broman_data_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Broman and Woo 2018</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>There is also the consideration that some statistical programs do not allow blank values (e.g., Mplus), and therefore missing values will need to be assigned at some point. Yet, as I mentioned earlier in this chapter, it is best to not make decisions based on one potential use case. It is better to make decisions based on what is the most reasonable way to assign missing values for a general audience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The other option is to define missing codes and add them to your data. This code can be numeric (e.g., “missing” = -999) or character (e.g., “missing” = ‘NA’) and it may be one consistent code applied to all missing data, or it may be multiple codes assigned for different types of missing data.
<ul>
<li>One benefit of this method is that this removes the uncertainty that we had with blank cells. If a value is filled, we are now certain the value was not deleted or skipped over during data entry.</li>
<li>Another benefit is that this allows you to specify distinct reasons for missing data (e.g., “Not Applicable” = -97, “Skipped” = -98) if that is important for your study.</li>
<li>The biggest problem that can occur with this method is that either your codes could be mistaken for actual values (if someone misses the documentation on missing values), or if you use a value that does not match your variable type, then you introduce new variable type issues (e.g., if ‘NULL’ is used in a numeric variable, that variable will no longer be numeric)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, whichever method you choose, there are several guidelines you should follow.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If you decide to fill with defined missing codes, use values that match your variable type (e.g., numeric codes for numeric variables) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-icpsr_guide_2020" role="doc-biblioref">ICPSR 2020</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-white_nine_2013" role="doc-biblioref">White et al. 2013</a>)</span>
<ul>
<li>There is, however, some merit to using text to define missing values in numeric variables to prevent incorrect use of missing values. If you try to run a mean on your variable, you will be immediately notified that this is not possible because your variable will be stored as a character column. If you do not care about the different types of missingness, you could easily then choose to change all missing codes to blank. However, if you do care about the types of missingness and want to keep that included in your variable, you will need to match variable type.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you use numeric values, use extreme values that do not actually occur in your data</li>
<li>Use your values consistently within and across variables</li>
</ol>
<p>In your value coding style guide, you can add general rules to follow, or it may be an appropriate place to actually designate a missing value coding schema for your project (see Figure <a href="style.html#fig:fig9-4">9.4</a>).</p>

<p>If your team plans to clean data using code, it can be very helpful to create a coding style guide. This style guide can be tailored to a specific language that all staff will use (such as R or Stata), or it can be written more generically to apply to any coding language staff use to clean data. Below is a small sampling of good coding practices to consider adding to your guide. If you are looking for guides for a specific language, it can be very helpful to search online for existing style guides in that language.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider building and implementing coding templates <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-daskalova_coding_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Daskalova 2020</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-farewell_my_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Farewell 2018</a>)</span>
<ul>
<li>Templates can standardize the format of syntax files (such as using standard headers to break up code)</li>
<li>They also standardize the summary information provided at the beginning of your syntax (code author, project name, date created)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use comments throughout your code to clearly explain the purpose of each code chunk
<ul>
<li>The format of these comments will be dependent on your coding language
<ul>
<li>R uses <code>#</code> at the start of a comment</li>
<li>SPSS and Stata use <code>*</code> at the start of a comment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improve code readability by using <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-wickham_welcome_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Wickham 2021</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-san_martin_stata_2023" role="doc-biblioref">San Martin, Rodriguez-Ramirez, and Suzuki 2023</a>)</span>
<ul>
<li>spaces</li>
<li>indentation</li>
<li>setting a line limit for your code (e.g., 80 characters)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use relative file paths for reproducibility
<ul>
<li>Setting absolute file paths in syntax reduces reproducibility because future users may have different file paths. It is important to set file paths relative the directory you are working in <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-wickham_welcome_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Wickham and Grolemund 2017</a>)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you create objects in your program (like you do in R or Python), consider adding object naming rules similar to variable naming rules
<ul>
<li>No spaces in object names</li>
<li>No special characters except <code>_</code> to separate words</li>
<li>No names that are existing program keywords (<code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduce duplication, improve efficiency, and increase your ability to troubleshoot errors by following the DRY (don’t repeat yourself) principle. Consider using functions, loops, or macros for repetitive code chunks.</li>
<li>Record session information for future users
<ul>
<li>Record both version information as well as operating system information relevant to your code to increase the reproducibility of your code</li>
