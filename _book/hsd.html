<p>In addition to understanding how to organize data, we also need a foundational understanding of the types of data we may collect. In the field of education research, we are often working with data that is collected from human subjects. Along with collecting data from people comes the responsibility to secure that data. Data from humans may contain identifiable information increasing the risk that participants can be revealed in a dataset. Human subjects data sometimes also contains information on sensitive topics such as mental health, drug use, or criminal behavior, further increasing risks if participants are identified. Before beginning your project, it is important to assess the type of data you will be collecting and understand the protections that will need to be in place to secure your data. This chapter will briefly review the types of human subjects data you may work with as well as any regulations, organizations, policies, or agreements that may impact how you need to secure your data.</p>

</h2>
<p>When working with human subjects there are two types of identifiers you may collect in your study, direct and indirect (see Table <a href="hsd.html#tab:tab4-1">4.1</a>). Direct identifiers are unique to an individual and can be used to identify a participant. Indirect identifiers are not necessarily unique to a particular individual, but if combined with other information they could be used to identify a participant <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-kopper_data_2023" role="doc-biblioref">Kopper, Sautmann, and Turitto 2023a</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>A term often used when discussing identifiable information is personally identifiable information (PII). This term broadly refers to information that can be used to identify a participant. There is no agreed-upon list for what fields should be included in a list of PII but generally it includes both the direct and indirect types of information shown in Table <a href="hsd.html#tab:tab4-1">4.1</a>.</p>
<p>When collecting data and creating datasets, you will be working with one or more of these four types of data files <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-unc_office_of_human_research_ethics_-identified_2020" role="doc-biblioref">UNC Office of Human Research Ethics 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identifiable: Data includes personally identifiable information. It is common for your raw research study data to be identifiable.</li>
<li>Coded: In this type of data file, PII has been removed or distorted and names are replaced with a code (i.e., a unique participant identifier). The only way to link the data back to an individual is through that code. The identifying code file (linking key) is stored separate from the research data (see Chapter <a href="track.html#track">10</a>). Coded data is typically the type of file you create after cleaning your raw study data.</li>
<li>De-identified: In this type of file, identifying information has been removed or distorted and the data can no longer be reassociated with the underlying individual (the linking key no longer exists). This is typically what you create when publicly sharing your research study data.</li>
<li>Anonymous: In an anonymous dataset, no identifying information is ever collected and so there should be little to no risk of identifying a specific participant.</li>
</ol>

<div id="hsd-dcl" class="section level2" number="4.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Data classification<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#hsd-dcl"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Data is often classified based on the level of sensitivity <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-filip_san_2023" role="doc-biblioref">Filip 2023</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-macquarie_university_research_2023" role="doc-biblioref">Macquarie University 2023</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-university_of_michigan_examples_2023" role="doc-biblioref">University of Michigan 2023</a>)</span>. These levels of sensitivity dictate how the data can be collected, stored, and shared, as well as what the response should be to any data breach. Depending on the institution, the names for these levels, the number of levels, what is included in these levels, and the rules applied to the levels, all vary. While there is variation, here is a general summary of how information may be categorized.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Low sensitivity: This data is considered to have no or low risk if disclosed. This typically includes de-identified and anonymous data that does not contain highly sensitive information.</p></li>
<li><p>Moderate sensitivity: This data is considered to have moderate risk if disclosed, meaning it could adversely affect people. This data may include identifiable information or information that could allow participants to be re-identified within the data itself or using an external source. This data is typically required to be kept confidential by law or other agreements. These data should be protected against unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p>High sensitivity: This data should be under the most stringent security and could cause great harm if disclosed. This data includes PII or information that could allow participants to be re-identified, as well as private or highly sensitive information (e.g., illegal behaviors, medical records) and are typically required to be kept confidential by law or other agreements. These data should be protected against unauthorized access.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to review your institution’s data classification levels, or data sensitivity levels, to determine how your specific institution classifies data. These rules may come from an information technology department, an institutional review board (IRB), or a combination of both. Note that different data collection efforts in the same project can be classified in different ways.</p>

The requirements for these requests vary by district but they often include an application or proposal outlining research plans, as well as other supporting documents (e.g., copies of data collection instruments, IRB approval, agreement forms).

<li><p>DUA: A data use agreement (DUA), also sometimes referred to as a data sharing agreement (DSA), is a contractual agreement that provides the terms and conditions for sharing data. DUAs are commonly written for data sharing when partnering with school districts or state agencies. As an example, a DUA may include the terms for sharing, working with, and storing education records data. However, DUAs can be used to provide guidance for outgoing data as well (i.e., a researcher is sharing their original data with an agency). DUAs can be standalone documents or may be incorporated into other documents such as a memorandum of understanding (MOU).</p></li>

<p>Throughout the remaining chapters of this book, we will review ways to keep identifiable human subjects data secure in each phase of the research life cycle. With that said, below is a quick review of some of the most important things to remember if you are collecting data that contain PII.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In most situations it will be important to get consent to collect identifiers. Consult with your local IRB to determine what is required. See Section <a href="collect.html#collect-irb">11.2.5</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Collect as few identifiers as possible. Only collect what is necessary. See Section <a href="collect.html#collect-design">11.2.1</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Follow rules laid out in applicable laws, policies, and agreements when collecting, storing, and sharing data. This includes, but is not limited to, using approved tools for data collection, capture, and storage, assigning appropriate data access levels, and transmitting data using approved methods. See Chapters <a href="collect.html#collect">11</a>, <a href="capture.html#capture">12</a>, <a href="store.html#store">13</a>, and <a href="store-long.html#store-long">15</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Remove names in data and replace them with codes (i.e., unique study identifiers). See Sections <a href="track.html#track-ids">10.4</a> and <a href="clean.html#clean-steps">14.3.1</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Fully de-identify data before publicly sharing it. See Section <a href="share.html#share-assess">16.2.3.4</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Use data sharing agreements and controlled access as needed when publicly sharing data. See Section <a href="share.html#share-able">16.2.1</a> for more information.</li>
