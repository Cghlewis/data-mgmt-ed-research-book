The following information was added to Section \@ref(public-capture) to clarify the importance of documenting the date that public files are extracted.

"When extracting public data files, I highly recommend to always include the date of extraction in the file name (e.g., `name_of_file_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`). Public data is often continually being updated and it is important to document when files were extracted for purposes of reproducibility and data lineage."
